Dasypeltis: The Egg-Eater
===========
This is a modern take on the classic game Snake. Dasypeltis is a genus of snakes that feeds solely on eggs. The goal of this game is to eat as many eggs as possible without running into a wall (the border) or coming into contact with yourself.

How To Play
-----------
Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right. The spacebar will pause (and resume) the game.

Be prepared, this snake is quick. Good luck!
